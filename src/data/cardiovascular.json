    "Functions": "Gap27 is designed to mimic the function of Cx43, which is crucial for intercellular communication in the heart. Cx43 plays a significant role in the conduction of electrical impulses between cardiomyocytes, which is essential for maintaining normal heart rhythm and function.",
    "Activity": "Gap27 has been shown to improve cardiac function and reduce arrhythmogenesis in heart failure models. Specifically, it decreases the progression of cardiac dysfunction, reduces the incidence and severity of arrhythmias, and mitigates cardiac hypertrophy and adverse remodeling in high-output heart failure conditions.The peptide works by potentially influencing the phosphorylation status of Cx43, particularly at the S368 site, which is associated with the lateralization of Cx43 in cardiomyocytes"
